I started to learn programming in March 2020, 
begun with Python basics and went over to Java language.

Within three months I was able to build very basic Android apps,
I understood the basics of Object Oriented Programming,
most of my exercises I did using CodeWars KATA's.

After three months of intensive learning I had to come back to regular work
with plenty of business trips. Due to that fact I did nothing with programming
in period of mid-June to mid-November. 

Now I hope to come back to intensive learning process
and will commit further codes/projects continuously
